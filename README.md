# Macrorouting Tool
A mod by aqmlyn for the game [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/). It provides a UI for users to create and modify a [weighted graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Weighted_graph) detailing possible routes through a map, then choose and compare specific routes based on the info in the graph.
